          Chemistry is a branch of natural science that deals principally with the properties of
          molecules, the chemical reactions that occur between them, and the natural laws that
          describe molecular interactions. Chemistry is a central science, having strong
          interactions with biology, medicine, earth and environmental sciences, physics and
          mathematics. A BS Chemistry degree prepares students for graduate school, the health
          professions, careers in the chemical industry, teaching at a high school level, and a host
          of other career options.
