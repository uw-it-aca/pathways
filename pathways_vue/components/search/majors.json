Our main fields of research and pedagogy focus on the United States but also extend into questions about global and transnational dimensions, concepts and histories concerning race and ethnicity in America. Students earn a BA degree in American Ethnic Studies by taking core courses on ethnic-specific and comparative, multi-ethnic subjects. At the same time, they develop an emphasis in one of our concentrations â€” African American Studies, Asian American/Pacific Islander Studies, Chicano/a Studies or Comparative AES â€” that make up the major. Graduates of this degree pursue careers in a variety of fields such as education, business, law, public policy, media and communication, nonprofit and health care.",

Because of their simplicity and rapid growth rates, microorganisms are readily amenable to study in the laboratory. Because their cellular processes closely resemble those of higher organisms, they are ideally suited for fundamental studies of biological structure, physiology, metabolism, genetics and development. The Microbiology department at the University of Washington works mainly in cutting edge research in Bacteria and Viruses. The B.S. in Microbiology is complemented by the College of Arts and Sciences general educational requirements such as English Composition, Writing, Foreign Language, Quantitative & Symbolic Reasoning, Visual Literary & Performing Arts and Individuals and Societies courses which provide a comprehensive liberal arts degree.<br><br><strong>Minor available</strong>",

Undergraduates acquire knowledge of political institutions in the United States and around the world. Students learn to think critically as they evaluate conflicting claims about what government can and should do. They explore how mass political behavior influences law and policy and study how government capacities and popular commitments to democracy vary across time and location. As they read, write research and debate, they learn to evaluate complicated issues and communicate effectively on controversial topics.
