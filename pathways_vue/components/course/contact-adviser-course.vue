      <p>
        We understand this can be a challenging process with many sources of information to
        consider. This webpage is designed to be a useful tool but not a replacement for meeting
        with an academic adviser. As you begin to consider what you want to major in, we recommend
        scheduling a meeting with your adviser to discuss your interests, goals, degree requirements
        and academic planning.
