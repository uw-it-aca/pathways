Like any great art, mathematics has an intrinsic beauty and coherence that has attracted practitioners for centuries. Yet, unlike other arts, math is a surprisingly effective tool for describing the natural world.  Math has come to serve as the foundation of modern science, through its language and results. Some mathematical results were initially developed in order to solve internally generated mathematical problems and only later found application in other disciplines; other mathematical results were inspired by the needs of these other disciplines. The two facets of mathematics - tool of science and subject of inquiry for its own sake - have come to be interwoven into a complex fabric.", "major_admission": "capacity-constrained", "major_home_url": "www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/mathematics.html", "common_course_decl": {"MATH 126": {"percent": 77, "title": "Calculus with Analytic Geometry III"}, "MATH 308": {"percent": 69, "title": ""}, "MATH 307": {"percent": 67, "title": ""}, "CSE 142": {"percent": 57, "title": "Computer Programming I"}, "CSE 143": {"percent": 56, "title": "Computer Programming II"}, "ENGL 131": {"percent": 40, "title": "Composition: Exposition"}, "MATH 324": {"percent": 39, "title": ""}, "MATH 125": {"percent": 37, "title": "Calculus with Analytic Geometry II"}, "CSE 190": {"percent": 35, "title": "Current Topics in Computer Science and Engineering"}, "PHYS 121": {"percent": 35, "title": "Mechanics"}}, "2_yr": {"0": 0, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0, "9": 0, "10": 0, "11": 0, "12": 0, "13": 0, "14": 0, "15": 0, "16": 0, "17": 0, "18": 0, "19": 0, "20": 0, "21": 0, "22": 0, "23": 0, "24": 0, "25": 0, "26": 0, "27": 1, "28": 1, "29": 2, "30": 3, "31": 3, "32": 8, "33": 8, "34": 23, "35": 33, "36": 49, "37": 71, "38": 81, "39": 51, "40": 12}, "5_yr": {"0": 0, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0, "9": 0, "10": 0, "11": 0, "12": 0, "13": 0, "14": 0, "15": 0, "16": 0, "17": 0, "18": 0, "19": 0, "20": 1, "21": 0, "22": 0, "23": 1, "24": 0, "25": 1, "26": 1, "27": 4, "28": 2, "29": 8, "30": 14, "31": 23, "32": 33, "33": 41, "34": 97, "35": 123, "36": 151, "37": 188, "38": 203, "39": 134, "40": 33}, "credential_title": "Mathematics (BA)", "credential_code": "MATH-0-1-1", "credential_description": "The Standard option is intended for students who are interested in a versatile degree in Mathematics.
