It will train students to be socially conscious designers who understand the importance of community voices, the dynamics of poser, and the challenges of creating a resilient urban environment with a focus on spatial equality.  Students will acquire skills in visual communication, design thinking, and community engaged design processes, computer graphics and the use of digital technologies for visualization, analysis, and methods of data gathering and dissemination."}, "ECENG-0-1-6": {"major_code": "ECENG", "program_code": "UG-ECENG-MAJOR", "major_title": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "major_school": "College of Engineering", "major_campus": "Seattle", "major_description": "Electrical and Computer Engineering students study the design, production, operation and application of devices and systems that use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.
