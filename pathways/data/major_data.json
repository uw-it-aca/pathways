The Architectural Design major is a pre-professional studio based degree that prepares most students for graduate study in architecture and a professional career in the field.  Both programs share a commitment to architecture and design as a field of knowledge that can have a profound impact on contemporary society. Non-majors interested in architecture are able to pursue a Minor in Architectural Design.", "major_admission": "capacity-constrained", "major_home_url": "www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/archit.html", "common_course_decl": {"ARCH 351": {"percent": 7, "title": "Architecture of the Medieval and Early Modern World"}, "ARCH 352": {"percent": 6, "title": "History of Modern Architecture"}, "ARCH 200": {"percent": 6, "title": "Architectural Design and Representation I"}, "ARCH 350": {"percent": 5, "title": "Architecture of the Ancient World"}, "ARCH 231": {"percent": 5, "title": "Making and Craft"}, "ARCH 201": {"percent": 5, "title": "Architectural Design and Representation II"}, "ARCH 380": {"percent": 3, "title": "Computers in Architecture"}, "MATH 124": {"percent": 2, "title": "Calculus with Analytic Geometry I"}, "ARCH 402": {"percent": 2, "title": "Architectural Design VI"}, "ENGL 131": {"percent": 2, "title": "Composition: Exposition"}}, "2_yr": {"0": 0, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0, "9": 0, "10": 0, "11": 0, "12": 0, "13": 0, "14": 0, "15": 0, "16": 2, "17": 0, "18": 0, "19": 1, "20": 1, "21": 0, "22": 0, "23": 0, "24": 0, "25": 0, "26": 0, "27": 3, "28": 2, "29": 6, "30": 11, "31": 8, "32": 16, "33": 30, "34": 26, "35": 46, "36": 77, "37": 92, "38": 131, "39": 87, "40": 23}, "5_yr": {"0": 1, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0, "9": 0, "10": 0, "11": 0, "12": 0, "13": 0, "14": 1, "15": 0, "16": 2, "17": 0, "18": 0, "19": 2, "20": 3, "21": 0, "22": 0, "23": 1, "24": 3, "25": 2, "26": 4, "27": 4, "28": 11, "29": 18, "30": 34, "31": 32, "32": 76, "33": 134, "34": 184, "35": 306, "36": 465, "37": 420, "38": 460, "39": 209, "40": 47}, "credential_title": "Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in Architecture", "credential_code": "ARCH-0-1-1", "credential_description": "The Architecture major is a four-year, Bachelor of Arts degree program in which students explore the many factors that shape our built environment.

We approach topics from transnational and intersectional perspectives, enabling students to analyze and address issues of gender, sexuality, and social difference at personal, historical, institutional, and structural levels. In our classes we study texts, histories, and experiences from the Global North and South, and examine gender and sexuality as they intersect with race, class, ethnicity, nation, ability, cisgender privilege and other forms of power.\nGWSS is devoted to generating and bringing visibility to many kinds of feminist knowledge production such as women of color feminism, transfeminism, queer feminism, feminist science and technology studies, and more. GWSS scholars therefore represent a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds, and conduct research in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and arts.", "major_admission": "capacity-constrained", "major_home_url": null, "common_course_decl": {"BIS 300": {"percent": 41, "title": "Interdisciplinary Inquiry"}, "B WRIT 135": {"percent": 25, "title": "Research Writing"}, "BISGWS 301": {"percent": 23, "title": "Critical Gender and Sexuality Studies"}, "BISGWS 302": {"percent": 20, "title": "Histories and Movements of Gender and Sexuality"}, "BISGWS 303": {"percent": 16, "title": "Approaches to Feminist Inquiry"}, "BIS 224": {"percent": 15, "title": "Introduction to Feminist Studies"}, "B WRIT 134": {"percent": 13, "title": "Composition"}, "BIS 341": {"percent": 13, "title": "Topics in the Study of Culture"}, "BIS 312": {"percent": 13, "title": "Approaches to Social Research"}, "BIS 490": {"percent": 11, "title": "Advanced Seminar"}}, "2_yr": {"0": 0, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0, "9": 0, "10": 0, "11": 0, "12": 0, "13": 0, "14": 0, "15": 0, "16": 0, "17": 0, "18": 0, "19": 0, "20": 0, "21": 0, "22": 0, "23": 0, "24": 0, "25": 0, "26": 0, "27": 0, "28": 0, "29": 0, "30": 0, "31": 0, "32": 3, "33": 3, "34": 2, "35": 2, "36": 4, "37": 3, "38": 6, "39": 18, "40": 8}, "5_yr": {"0": 0, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0, "9": 0, "10": 0, "11": 0, "12": 0, "13": 0, "14": 1, "15": 0, "16": 0, "17": 0, "18": 0, "19": 0, "20": 0, "21": 0, "22": 0, "23": 0, "24": 0, "25": 3, "26": 4, "27": 2, "28": 2, "29": 1, "30": 2, "31": 11, "32": 11, "33": 9, "34": 5, "35": 14, "36": 17, "37": 20, "38": 26, "39": 52, "40": 28}, "credential_title": "Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies", "credential_code": "B GWSS-0-1-1", "credential_description": "Gender, Women & Sexuality Studies (GWSS) examines social and political realities shaped by gender, sexuality, and power.
