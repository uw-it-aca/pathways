We draw from interdisciplinary theories across the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences to consider how these concerns are mapped, represented, and understood in a changing world, and to offer theoretically informed and empirically based responses. Our students are deeply engaged in community service through internships, service learning, and senior projects, which center upon questions of environmental and social justice. Our undergraduate majors employ social and political theories; develop the ability to create and analyze maps and other forms of geo-visualization; gather, analyze and interpret quantitative and qualitative data; and write clear and compelling research reports and papers.", "major_admission": "minimumRequirements", "major_home_url": "www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/geography.html", "common_course_decl": {"CSE 142": {"percent": 89, "title": "Computer Programming I"}, "GEOG 360": {"percent": 86, "title": "GIS and Mapping"}, "GEOG 315": {"percent": 79, "title": "Explanation and Understanding in Geography"}, "INFO 200": {"percent": 73, "title": "Intellectual Foundations of Informatics"}, "CSE 143": {"percent": 72, "title": "Computer Programming II"}, "GEOG 258": {"percent": 67, "title": "Digital Geographies"}, "INFO 201": {"percent": 57, "title": "Foundational Skills for Data Science"}, "MATH 126": {"percent": 45, "title": "Calculus with Analytic Geometry III"}, "PHYS 121": {"percent": 45, "title": "Mechanics"}, "MATH 125": {"percent": 40, "title": "Calculus with Analytic Geometry II"}}, "2_yr": {"0": 2, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0, "9": 0, "10": 0, "11": 0, "12": 1, "13": 0, "14": 0, "15": 0, "16": 0, "17": 3, "18": 0, "19": 1, "20": 9, "21": 17, "22": 27, "23": 19, "24": 24, "25": 25, "26": 36, "27": 25, "28": 36, "29": 38, "30": 56, "31": 70, "32": 118, "33": 133, "34": 113, "35": 121, "36": 154, "37": 146, "38": 117, "39": 48, "40": 82}, "5_yr": {"0": 2, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0, "9": 2, "10": 1, "11": 0, "12": 2, "13": 3, "14": 7, "15": 8, "16": 5, "17": 10, "18": 18, "19": 16, "20": 44, "21": 64, "22": 76, "23": 79, "24": 81, "25": 113, "26": 142, "27": 132, "28": 148, "29": 195, "30": 273, "31": 311, "32": 387, "33": 432, "34": 346, "35": 383, "36": 373, "37": 302, "38": 250, "39": 203, "40": 251}}, "TCSCI": {"major_code": "TCSCI", "program_code": "UG-TCSCI-MAJOR", "major_title": "Computer Science and Systems", "major_school": "School of Engineering and Technology", "major_campus": "Tacoma", "major_description": "The Computer Science and Systems (CSS) program provides a broad approach to computer science and software design.
